A Free fast access to pages within the Wordpress Dashboard.

== Description ==

CCG Quickly allows you to quickly access certain aspects of the Wordpress Dashboard no matter where you are.  

When logged into your Wordpress website the Wordpress heading banner is available for you to gain quick access to certain plugins.
CCG Quickly allows you even fast access to certain pages within the Wordpress Admin with one a single click of that particular page you wish to view.
Further settings to the Plugin found within Tools >> CCG Quickly allows you to turn on even faster access to editing individual pages of your Wordpress website.
Whereas you would normally have to Select Visit Dashboard, then select Pages, then select the page to edit you can with CCG Quickly select the Page you want from a drop down menu taking you directly to the page to edit in one click.


Further direct access is also available for Media, Add Media, Settings, Posts, Add Post, Tools and Users.
The Menu layout is as follows:

CCG Quickly
--- Pages
    ---- Page 1
    ---- Page 2
    ---- ...
    Media
    Add Media
    Settings
    Post
    Add Post
    Tools
    Users

In the settings of the Plugin (Tools >> CCG Quickly) you can turn on or off any of these particular quick access links.

It can save valuable time in traversing the Wordpress Admin by allowing you to go directly to various standard WordPress Admin Pages.
